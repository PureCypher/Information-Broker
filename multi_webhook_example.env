# Multi-Webhook Discord Configuration Examples
# ============================================

# Option 1: Single webhook (backward compatible)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123456789/your-webhook-token-here

# Option 2: Multiple webhooks (new feature)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URLS=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/123/token1,https://discord.com/api/webhooks/456/token2,https://discord.com/api/webhooks/789/token3

# How it works:
# - If DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URLS is set, it will send to all listed webhooks
# - If only DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL is set, it falls back to single webhook
# - Webhooks are called concurrently for better performance
# - Each webhook has individual error handling and retry logic
# - Failed webhooks don't affect successful ones

# Common Discord settings (apply to all webhooks)
DISCORD_MAX_RETRIES=2
DISCORD_TIMEOUT=30s
